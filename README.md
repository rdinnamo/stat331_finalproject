STAT 331: Simple Linear Regression Analysis

Within this project, I and three other teammates performed and then analyzed the strength of a simple linear regression on overall happiness score and percentage of population with access to the Internet for countries across the world. These two variables were retrieved from separate datasets on https://www.gapminder.org/data/, and were chosen because our team had an interest in their relationship.

The respective datasets can be found in the `data` folder, and the writeup in its entirety can be viewed in either the `.rmd` or `.html` file format above.
